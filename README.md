Documentation of My Learning Journey at Delux Coding School

I am currently enrolled in a six-month Cybersecurity program at Delux Coding School. This documentation will serve as a record of my learning experience, progress, and achievements throughout the course.

I look forward to gaining valuable knowledge and skills in cybersecurity and wish myself success on this journey.

I am also glad to be working alongside my colleague, Ademide, who has been a supportive and collaborative partner in this learning experience.
